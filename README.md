# DocHub
an open sourced documentation website to help consolidate documentation for the myriad of programming languages

# why am i doing this?
because when i was first learning how to code the documentation was abysmal. this threw me into fits of rage so often that i nearly quit had it not been for my pro dev friend cheering me on i would have.

# how can YOU help?
write documentation in this format:

doc title ((be specific.)e.g. 
python version, module name, module attribute in question
"how to use from typing import Union")

explanation of the module and what youll be using it for in this case

breakdown of the functions and/or classes
breakdown of specific changes to how it works if applicable
breakdown of compatibility issues with other modules of this type (unnecessary, but someone will have to do this at some point)

image or (preferably)markdown of at least 3 code examples
if incompatible with certain os in this way, provide ways to make it compatible!

summary of how it works and why it is done this way specifically

links to other docs for other ways to do it if applicable (done by moderator(me unfortunately))



# how can i earn respect as a developer?
well that ones easy, document your code! when you were learning im positive there was a obscure library everyone was saying was the best fit for your issue, 
but alas it had little to no documentation...
so you didnt use it and used 3 other modules because what else are you supposed to do without base knowledge of what your doing in a subject other than bumble around like an idjit. 

you, the dev, can help fix this issue, document your code.
